Reduce the learning rate: A lower learning rate can help your model focus more on the training data and avoid overfitting. However, it may also increase the number of training iterations needed to achieve good performance.

Increase the batch size: Increasing the batch size during training can help your model generalize better and rely more on the training data. However, a larger batch size may also require more memory and processing power.

Use a smaller model architecture: A smaller model architecture can help your model focus more on the training data by reducing the number of parameters it has to learn. However, this may also limit its ability to generalize to new data.

Increase the weight of the loss function: By increasing the weight of the loss function during training, you can place more emphasis on the training data and less on the model's pre-existing knowledge. This can be done by setting the weight of the loss function to a higher value, such as 2 or 3.

Increase the number of training epochs: Increasing the number of training epochs can allow the model to learn more from the training data and rely more on it. However, this may also increase the risk of overfitting.

Use a smaller portion of the pre-training data: You can fine-tune your model on a smaller portion of the pre-training data to help it focus more on the training data. This can be done by specifying a smaller value for the --num_train_epochs flag during training.
